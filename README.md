This is an MCP that I will be using while creating Expo React Native web and mobile applications. It has significant resources based on my learning and application of concepts and paradigms that I want to easily continue to use. These guides are for my reference as well as for the AI.


This information from my own research and tinkering as well as from learning from great educators online such as Simon from Galaxies.Dev and CodewWithBeto, the Expo team, Software Mansion, and more. I'll try to add more credits later but please feel free to use this and add anything to it.
